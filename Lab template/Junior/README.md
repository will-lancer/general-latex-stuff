This is my lab template for a junior year physics lab;
in my specific case, this is PHY 335 at Stony Brook University.
It's more or less just my basic LaTeX template, with some
goodies added by James Cross and myself. I basically copy and pasted
it from my IDE to here, but I might've accidentially deleted some stuff
along the way; if something doesn't work lmk at william.lancer@stonybrook.edu.
