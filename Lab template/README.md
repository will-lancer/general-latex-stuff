This is my template for general physics lab stuff.
The original code was found by Googling ``Lab template'';
you can find the original source [here](https://www.latextemplates.com/template/university-school-laboratory-report).

Some alterations I made:
* Threw out most of the sections and changed formatting from a chemistry lab to a physics lab.
* Changed the margin size to allow for more lab per unit page.
* Added multiple useful commands for ease of writing.
* Added templates for inserting double pictures/tables into the doc. Super useful when you're trying to save page count.
* Added the required questions found in the base instructions for the lab. Saves me from running back to check every time I do one of these.
* Miscellany quality improvements.

Overview of files included:
* `lab template.tex`: this is the file you will be editing. It has all of the stuff you need for editing and doing the lab.
* `labby boi.tex`: this is the formatting file. You will need to load it into the thing you're using to write LaTeX in.
* `error calc div.py`: this is a super quick py file I made to do error propagation calculations for me. This is used for division, as you might guess from the name.
* `error calc mult.py`: this is a py file used for multiplication error propagation.
