This is my template for general physics lab stuff.
The original code was found by Googling ``Lab template'';
you can find the original source [here](https://www.latextemplates.com/template/university-school-laboratory-report).

Some alterations I made:
* Threw out most of the sections and changed formatting from a chemistry lab to a physics lab.
* Changed the margin size to allow for more lab per unit page.
* Added multiple useful commands for ease of writing.
* Added templates for inserting double pictures/tables into the doc. Super useful when you're trying to save page count.
* Added the required questions found in the base instructions for the lab. Saves me from running back to check every time I do one of these.
* Miscellany quality improvements.
