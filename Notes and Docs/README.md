These are the notes and document templates I use.
The original source is from Kevin Zhou;
please see his website [here](https://knzhou.github.io)
for the unaltered templates.

Some alterations I've made:
* Added ~100 custom commands for personal ease of use.
* Added multiple new theorems and color box templates.
* Added new environment for creating alphabet lists instead of enumerated lists.
* Added some convenient commands for making matrices.
* amogus :3 😈 📮
* Pilastro...
* Saved a lot of bummy commands LaTeX auto-gives you (like who actually types \nabla for the gradient 💀).
* Various other things that I'm probably forgetting.

The files in this folder:
* `Doc template.tex`. This is, as you might guess, for general document use. I also use it for homework.
* `Notes template.tex`. Unless you have an Albert Einstein intelligence level and Sherlock Holmes level
sleuthing skills, I don't know if you would have been able to guess that this is a template for notes... which it is.
* `william.sty`. This is the formatting file for the documents. You will need to load it into your editor to use either of the templates.
Feel free to boot-gang my files at any time and change everything to your name and likeness ❤️.
