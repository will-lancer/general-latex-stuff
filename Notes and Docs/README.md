These are the notes and document templates I use.
The original source is from Kevin Zhou;
please see his website [here](https://knzhou.github.io)
for the unaltered templates.

Some alterations I've made:
* Added >50 custom commands for personal ease of use.
* Added multiple new theorems and color box templates.
* Added new environment for creating alphabet lists instead of enumerated lists.
* Various other things that I'm probably forgetting.
