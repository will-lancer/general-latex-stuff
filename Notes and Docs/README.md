These are the notes and document templates I use.
The original source is from Kevin Zhou;
please see his website [here](https://knzhou.github.io)
for the unaltered templates.

Some alterations I've made:
* Added >50 custom commands for personal ease of use.
* Added multiple new theorems and color box templates.
* Added new environment for creating alphabet lists instead of enumerated lists.
* Various other things that I'm probably forgetting.

The files in this folder:
* `Doc template.tex`. This is, as you might guess, for general document use. I also use it for homework.
* `Notes template.tex`. This is a template for notes. Yeah.
* `william.sty`. This is the formatting file for the notes. You will need to load it into your editor to use either of the templates.
