# general-latex-stuff
Storage for my LaTeX templates and stuff like that.
One of the main uses of this is to refer my friends
to this repository instead of emailing them my templates
for LaTeX.

NOTE: for most of my templates, the base code was
written by someone else, and I added my own stuff to
it. Explicit credit is given in the template READMEs.
I customized the templates in here, and added things I found convenient;
I do not claim originality for the base templates that I work with.
However, the alterations I have made are significant,
so expect serious deviations from the original templates.
